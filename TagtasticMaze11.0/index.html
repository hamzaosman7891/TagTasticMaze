				<h3 class="about-title text-center">Game Description</h3>
				<p>
					‘TagTastic’ , an online multiplayer game predominantly in 2D with the main concept of the game
					being based around various players all battling to be tagged as the aim of the game is to hold onto your tags and not let the opposition tag you and retrieve them. Each game starts off with a
					randomly generated maze-based map, all players are untagged, and the tag is spawned in a random
					location on the map which the players will race towards to obtain and gain points. The way to win the match, is for a player to hold onto the tag for a duration of time. Futhermore, we have made it so that the maze can change through the use of powerups making it even harder to beat the timer. Every player will have a display of the map therefore they will be able to see the whole map and the positions
					of opponents in the game, making every turn and corner dangerous! The game will have an array of special powers such as speed boost and the ability to break through the maze walls. The radar sits on top of your view so the players POV will be slightly obscure. This is an exciting game for kids and adults alike.
